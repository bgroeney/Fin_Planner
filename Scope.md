Project Scope

This project will create a financial planning application that allows for tracking of performance and portfolio allocation. Importantly where this application will be unique to other offerings is that it will record reasons for financial decisions and analyse these overtime. Further, it will provide AI powered recommendations on each allocation in the portfolio. Perodically, it will suggest actions for portfolio rebalancing. There should be a list of decisions - AI generated recommendations that can be approved or rejected, plus each manual adjustment should be captured overtime.

Additionally, it should follow best practice for portfolio allocation where the primary target is sufficent diversification, with secondary asest targets in each category. The categories shall be:
- Australian Equities - Large Cap
- Australian Equities - Mid Cap
- Australian Equities - Junior/Small/Emerging
- Australian Property
- International - Large Cap
- International - Mid Cap
- International - Small Cap
- International - Emerging
- International - Property
- International - Commodities
- Fixed Interest
- Cash

AI shall be used to retrieve portfolio performance and compare with industry benchmark for under/over performance. Further, a button to generate a detailed analaysis of each allocation shall be created. This should provide a summary recommendation - buy, sell, hold, plus a detailed analysis of the reasons for this recommendation.

Additionally, in Phase 2, decision making shall be stress tested in a format similar to projectionlab.com (review this for requirements)

As part of this scope - you will need to review the existing landscape for inspiration in developing the solution.
