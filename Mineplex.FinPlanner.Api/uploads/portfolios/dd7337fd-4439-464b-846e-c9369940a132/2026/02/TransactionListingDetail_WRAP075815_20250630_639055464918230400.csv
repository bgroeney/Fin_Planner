"Important information"
"This report has been prepared using an estimate of your cash balance based on the most recent information available to Netwealth for the reporting period selected. The amounts shown are reflective of transactions over the period, but do not represent a guarantee in the value of your cash or your superannuation benefit. This is because the amounts may not take into account all income entitled to be received, and/or any fees, costs, taxes or other amounts liable to be paid. If you request to make a withdrawal, or are eligible to request a benefit payment, the actual amount available will be determined at the time any such payment is made. The effect of displaying figures to 2 decimal places may lead to some rounding errors. You should refer to the PDF version of this report for further explanation about the data."

"Inception date used in the report is the earlier of the date on which the first amount of money was contributed into your Wealth Accelerator account, or the earliest acquisition date we have recorded for adviser managed assets."
